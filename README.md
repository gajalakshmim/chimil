# chimil
django webapp

This is the code for Chimil.com, a web application where I try to implement various concepts I learn in django. 
    
    # the Home page describes my various intentions in developing and learning this web application.
    # the Calculator page is a simple application that implements addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
    # the Consume API page is an application where I try to utilize some of the publicly available apis such as github 
      api and a dictionary api. Also I have plans for implementing weather and news apis in future.
    # the Provide API page is an application where I provide api for the external world. Basically I constructed an employee
      object with few attributes and share them with others as APIs(eventhough it's not fair to share employee details 
      with others ;P )
    
    So these are the stuffs, you find here. Since my web application is under construction, you will find changes and updates
    now and then.
    
    Thanks for taking a look at my code.
